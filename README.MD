# Google API Key

After 90 days of inactivity, Google disables the Youtube v3 API key. When you use this program, the API key will probably be disabled. You can create your own at on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api). Put the API key into `/resources/app/app/database_reading.js`.
